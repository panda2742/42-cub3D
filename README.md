# Features

## 🔍 High-Performance Raycasting

At the core of the project, a Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm ensures a fast and efficient 3D rendering of the walls, guaranteeing a fluid experience even on complex maps.

## 🗺️ Robust Map Parsing

The program is capable of reading and interpreting map files in the .cub format. It includes comprehensive error handling, allowing it to detect and reject improperly formatted files for optimal stability.

## 💥 Wall Collisions

Player movements are realistically handled by a collision system that prevents them from walking through walls, making navigation through the maze more immersive.

## 🕺 Animated Sprites
An animated character sprite is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen, adding a dynamic and distinctive visual element to the interface.

## 🖱️ Fluid Camera Movements
Camera control is managed by the mouse, with a system designed to prevent pointer "leaks," ensuring a continuous and uninterrupted process.

## 🧭 Integrated Mini-map
To facilitate orientation, a real-time mini-map is displayed on the screen, allowing the player to visualize their position and the map's structure.

## 🚪 Interactive Doors
The player can interact with doors by pressing 'T', opening or closing them to access new areas and progress through the game.
